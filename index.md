# Hello!

This page lists my most interesting university projects. Please check out some of them! I have become a better programmer since university, but these projects show that I have been committed to writing well-structured and commented code for a long time. They also demonstrate that I am able to quickly pick up different languages.  Click the links to see the project pages.

## [Contact Manager App](project-pages/contactor/contactor.md) (Ionic/Angular/Google Cloud Platform)

This is a term-long project I completed for my directed studies course. This is the most frustrating project I've ever done because of all the issues I had with third-party plugins, coupled with the fact that it was my first time using Ionic, Angular, and Google Cloud Platform. However, I'm proud of how much code I wrote and what I was able to accomplish with my first app.

## [Julia Sets Generator](project-pages/julia-sets-generator/julia-sets-generator.md) (C/MPI Parallel Programming)

This is my term-project for my parallel programming course. It was fun to do, although I did have some trouble saving the image to a file and figuring out a colour scheme.

## [Apriori Implementation](project-pages/apriori/apriori.md) (Java)

This is an assignment I did for my data mining course. It finds the association rules of a dataset using the Apriori algorithm. The project demonstrates my knowledge of OOP and Java principles, data structures, and algorithms.

## [Client-server Application](project-pages/client-server/client-server.md) (Linux system programming)

This is the final project for my Linux system programming course, a client-server application for sending messages over a network.

## [Course Registration Browser Extension](project-pages/browser-extension/browser-extension.md) (JavaScript)

This is a summative project I did for my web technologies course in Winter 2018. It is a Chrome extension using JavaScript, PHP, and a database to store university course information and automate the
registration process. I am proud of the front-end and scripting work that I did, but I wish I spent more time
on it. I didn't anticipate how much time the front-end stuff would take, and so the code is not as clean as I'd like it.

## [Grading Website](project-pages/grading-website/grading-website.md) (PHP/Python/JavaScript - jQuery)

This is a semester-long project I co-led in Fall 2017. It is a grading website for the Computer Science
department that is being used currently. I helped manage and execute the design, QA, and front and back-end development. Python, PHP, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, and CSS are used. This is the project I am most proud of because of all the time I spent on it (I was the top committer) and all the things I learned.
