# Hello!

I have just graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Co-op Option and a Minor in History. I am currently looking for work as a software developer. Please check out some of my projects!

## [Contact Manager App](https://github.com/TroyNech/contactor) (Ionic/Angular/Google Cloud Platform)

This is a term-long project I completed for my directed studies course. This is the most frustrating project I've ever done because of all the issues I had with third-party plugins, coupled with the fact that it was my first time using Ionic, Angular, and Google Cloud Platform. However, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with my first app. I understand now why Angular and the like are so popular.

## [Julia Sets Generator](https://github.com/TroyNech/CP431) (C/MPI Parallel Programming)

This is my term-project for parallel programming course. It was fun to do, although I did have some trouble saving the image to a file and figuring out a colour scheme!

## [CP476-BrowserExtension](https://github.com/TroyNech/CP476-BrowserExtension) (JavaScript)

This is a summative project I did for my web technologies course in Winter 2018. It is a Chrome extension using JavaScript, PHP, and a database to store university course information and automate the
registration process. I am proud of the front-end and scripting work that I did, but I wish I spent more time
on it. I didn't anticipate how much time the front-end stuff would take, and so the code is not as clean as I'd like it.

## [CP317_MLS_Project](https://github.com/TroyNech/CP317_MLS_Project/tree/php) (PHP/JavaScript - jQuery)

This is a semester-long project I co-led in Fall 2017. It is a marking website for the Computer Science
department that is being used currently. I helped manage and execute the design, QA, and front and back-end development. Python, PHP, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, and CSS are used. This is the project I am most proud of because of all the time I spent on it and all the things I learned.
