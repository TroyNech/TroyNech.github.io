    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University. I have GitHub repos for the large
        projects I've completed for school. I've linked the best ones on this page.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The repos do not yet have their own pages. I will be adding those shortly!</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/TroyNech/CP476-BrowserExtension">CP476-BrowserExtension</a></h2>
    <p>This is a summative project I did for my web technologies course in Winter 2018. It is a Chrome extension
        using JavaScript, PHP, and a database to store university course information and automate the
        registration process. I am proud of the front-end and scripting work that I did, but I wish I spent more time
        on it. I didn't anticipate how much time the front-end stuff would take, and so the code is not as clean as I'd
        like it.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/TroyNech/CP317_MLS_Project/tree/php">CP317_MLS_Project</a></h2>
    <p>This is a semester-long project I co-led in Fall 2017. It is a marking website for the Computer Science
        department that is being used currently. I helped manage and execute the design, QA, and front and back-end development. Python,
        PHP, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, and CSS are used. This is the project I am most proud of because of all the time I spent on it and all
        the things I learned.</p>
